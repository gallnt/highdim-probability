\section{Chaining}
This chapter concerns some of the central methods for bounding random processes $(X_t)$. We'll go over concepts 
such as chaining, VC theory, generic chaining methods, and bounds such as Talagrand's inequality and Chevet's 
inequality. We'll apply these to concepts such as Monto Carlo integration, empirical processes, and statistical 
learning theory.
