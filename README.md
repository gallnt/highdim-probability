# Notes and Exercises to High-Dimensional Probability Second Edition

This github repository is served to put in my own notes and solutions to exercises to the second edition of High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science by Roman Vershynin. The aim for the notes is to fill up some of the gaps that were supposed to be filled in by the reader, while the exercises serve as practice to improve my understanding on the subject. 

Of course, there will be mistakes (both in the notes and the exercises) because I am human. Please let me know if there is a mistake so I can fix it! 

I want to thank professor Rayan Saab for giving me this opportunity to read this for my independent study.
