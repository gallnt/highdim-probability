\section{Deviations of Random Matrices on Sets}
The main question in this chapter is: How does an $m \times n$ matrix act on a general set $t \subset 
\mathbb{R}^n$?

\subsection{Matrix Deviation Inequality}
Take an $m \times n$ random matrix $X$ with independent, isotropic, and subgaussian rows. The concentration of 
the norm (\cref{thm:3.1.1}) tells us that for any fixed vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the approximation 
\[ \lVert Ax \rVert_{2} \approx \sqrt{m}\lVert x \rVert_{2} \]
holds with high probability.
