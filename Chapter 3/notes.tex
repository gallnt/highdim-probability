\section{Random Vectors in High Dimensions}
This chapter mainly deals with the curse of dimensionality, and howvectors interact in these 
high-dimensional settings.

\subsection{Concentration of the Norm}
\begin{theorem}[Concentration of the norm]
\label{thm:3.1.1}
Let $X = (X_1, \dots, X_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a random vector with independent, subgaussian coordinates 
$X_i$ satisfying $\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = 1$. Then 
\[ \left\lVert \lVert x \rVert_2 - \sqrt{n} \right\rVert_{\psi_2} \leq CK^2 \]
where $K = \max_{i} \lVert X_i \rVert_{\psi_2}$ and $C$ is an absolute constant.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Using \cref{prop:2.6.7}, we can rewrite the above as 
\[ P(\lVert X \rVert_2 - \sqrt{2} \geq t) \leq 2\exp{\left( -\frac{ct^2}{K^4} \right)} \text{ for all } 
t \geq 0. \]
We can prove the bound using Bernstein inequality. 
\end{proof}
